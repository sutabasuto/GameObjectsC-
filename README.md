# GameObjectsC-
A C++ project to create a GameObject architecture.
A one-week project aimed at exploring advanced concepts in the language and preparing a code library. The prerequisites include:

- A mathematical class for storing a 2D mathematical vector in memory, comprising X and Y components.
- A C++ Container class with similar functionalities to the std::vector class, capable of storing values in a dynamic array using functions.
- A GameObject class for storing various elements of an object in a game, including its coordinates and other types that can easily be added by creating a child class.
- A Colliders class for detecting object collisions and notifying the corresponding GameObject of collisions with square and circular shapes.
